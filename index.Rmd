## Main activities and timeline

### Develop core [curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ztVle5UL7TPJXh9v5amzKxRhEutRf4WqhdnCuaR7kwc/edit#)
### Organize a 1 week “sprint” session inviting core contributors (HDX, WFP, UNHCR) to build the skeleton and muscles of the core content.
### Refine content with support from DataCamp and possibly RStudio and test with large pool of IMO.
### Launch content online by end of 2018 advertise to users but also advertise so that content can be expanded/translated.
